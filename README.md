The game I made to learn how to program.
This was a project that I (Mike Griese) started years ago with a buddy of mine (@jchitel). We were both hyped from playing Minecraft, and felt like we were totally capable of making our own game too. We had big plans - it first started off as Minecraft mixed with Age of Empires, then we started really working on the basebuilding stuff, then there was a lot of exploration into more skills and combat focus... After a huge number of scope changes, we landed where it is now, on a procedural hack'n'slash with exploration stuff going on.

And it's still got crazy too large a scope.

There are somewhere in the neighborhood of 66k lines of code in here. And it's not nearly finished. I got the frameworks for so many things done - conditions, enchantments, animations, various different AI's, map generation, crazy skill trees, buildings, shops, dungeons... And yet, it's no where near feature complete. Like, just absolutely no where near. We had plans for like, 50 levels worth of content. Dungeons, bosses, loot, the works. It just takes more than 1.2 devs to do all of this. (Maybe more importantly, it takes more than one dev to make all the art for that.) 

## Building the project
You'll need Slick2D, and a 2.x version of lwjgl. Probably other stuff too. It just barely works on the OSX environment we were testing on in the first place, I don't expect it to *just work* on any system.

## The purpose of all this

This project consists of a huge amount of code I wrote over the first 3 years of my learning how to code. From the files at the very beginning of the process to the things at the very end, you can see huge changes in my ability as a developer, but also pure insights to what a novice is doing. This is the original, unfiltered code. Every `//fuck this is stupid whyyyyy` is left untouched. I felt it was right to leave it that way. If even a little bit of this code helps someone someday, that'd be cool.

Some time I should go and post the original design docs we had too. That would be another interesting insight into the young developer mind.

Maybe someday I'll come back and keep working on it. Clean it up a bit. It's been 2 years since any of it's been touched. I dunno.
